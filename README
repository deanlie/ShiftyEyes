Shifty Eyes is an Arduino project which controls a servo motor
to move two beads painted to look like eyeballs back and forth
at random. They are intended to be eyes in a portrait on a 
birch panel (with the electronics and mechanics in the
space in the back of the panel). The motion could be continuous
(probably not, because the battery would run out too soon),
random, or a reaction to viewer proximity, to sound in the room,
an IR remote control, etc. I sort of like "random." "Viewer
proximity" is good for interactivity, but expensive. "IR remote
control" is inexpensive, but limiting and not as surprising
to the viewer as I would like. "Ambient sound" is kind of
natural -- looking around when you hear a noise seems like
something a real person does. I don't know how easy that is
to accomplish with a piezo detector or if it would take a real
microphone.
